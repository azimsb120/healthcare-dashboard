## Improvements

This is a simple app to demonstrate how the technologies integrate. For a production-ready, enterprise application, many improvements are recommended, including but not limited to:

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement user authentication and role-based access control to ensure data security and privacy.
- **Advanced Filtering and Sorting**: Add more advanced filtering and sorting options.
- **Pagination**: Enhance pagination to include features like jump to page, items per page selection, and better navigation controls.
- **Data Validation**: Add comprehensive data validation both on the frontend and backend to ensure data integrity.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Improve the UI/UX with a more responsive design, better aesthetics, and user-friendly interactions.
- **Export Functionality**: Provide options to export the filtered and sorted data in various formats such as CSV, Excel, or PDF.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Enhance error handling on both frontend and backend, and implement robust logging and monitoring to track issues and performance.
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure the applicationâ€™s reliability and robustness.
- **Deployment and CI/CD**: Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.
